# Imbalanced_polariton_condensate

## This folder contains scripts used to produce results published in 
(Crescent states in charge-imbalanced polariton condensates)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07726]

File finite_T_min_init.py is the main file containing all the scripts required to produce the data

model_parameters.py contains parameters used in calculations

E_vs_T.ipynb is a python notebook demonstrating an example of running calculations to find how a system state chsanges upon varying temperature

Eq_two_min_with_phot.ipynb is a python notebook demonstrating en example of a regime supporting two local minima of a free energy

results folder containg data, which may be used in notebooks to plot figures without running the calculations
