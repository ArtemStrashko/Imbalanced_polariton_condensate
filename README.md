# Imbalanced_polariton_condensate

## This folder contains scripts used to produce results published in [Crescent states in charge-imbalanced polariton condensates](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.067405)

File finite_T_min_init.py is the main file containing all the scripts required to produce the data

1. model_parameters.py contains parameters used in calculations

2. E_vs_T.ipynb is a python notebook demonstrating an example of running calculations to find how a system state chsanges upon varying temperature

3. Eq_two_min_with_phot.ipynb is a python notebook demonstrating en example of a regime supporting two local minima of a free energy

4. results folder containg data, which may be used in notebooks to plot figures without running the calculations
